# Win Lose Poker

A game that simulates poker with a dealer, a user player and a couple of computer players.

---

## Basic functionality

- A round starts and all players ante up. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- A dealer deals cards to the players. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Players take turns to bet, call or fold. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Whoever either wins or is the last player in the hand wins the pot. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- If a player has no more money, they leave the table. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
- If the user player has no more money the game is over. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->


For the MVP, a game can consist of one hand and no animations.
